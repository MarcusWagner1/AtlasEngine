Hello, This is a personal project I am working on. As of 1/23/2025 I have displayed my first drawn triangle with color blending using the VulkanSDK. 

Alot of my code is obtained from the website https://vulkan-tutorial.com/

This website helped me understand concepts for the graphics card and how it can communicate with the program to get the data to draw. I went through and got the code, but the important aspect of this website was the detailed explanations that were given which helped me understand the terminology and the fundamentals of low level GPU drivers communication. I enjoy low level programming and since learning OPENGL I was looking for something a little more, or lets say Less abstracted than what we see with OpenGL. 

The code is very verbose which is a term that VULKAN is labeled with, however this allows for alot more control over each aspect that goes into drawing frames onto the screen. I am excited to part ways from the tutorial and implemenet my own code, but I still have some ways to go in order to set it up.

Next goals
- Get a 3D viewport going
- Get an .obj parser implemented
- Get a .json parser implemented
- Implement Physics (Possible particle physics simulation incoming? YAY)
- Post processing effect? Ooooo yes please.

  But first we have to reread everything I just read from the website because while I was taking notes and understand how to structure the code, as well as the order of function calls. I still want to get a better grasp on the concepts for possible future interviews and more creative freedom as I venture on with this project.

  So far has been alot of fun and have been just taking it one step at a time. But it has been worth it just to get this one singular triangle drawn, in a setting that would take me only  50-100 lines of code in OPENGL.
